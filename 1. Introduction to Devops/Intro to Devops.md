# <p align="center">Introduction to DevOps</p>


Consider a company, for example a one like the Twitter. So the programmers are responsible for coding the app and its features in the twitter. There will be a team of software developers for the application or a team for some specific features for big companies like the Twitter or Facebook.
That is a team of Devs will be working on the messenger feature of Facebook, some other team will be working on conversations API. So there is are the guys that write code for specific feature and also these are the guys that fix if any issue occurs.

The next stage will be the testing. Whenever a new feature is released, it should not break the old application, that is, people should be able to use it every time. So the people have to test it.
It will also be a hideous task to test a vert big app, so the testing thing will be made automated, that is a code which is testing a code.
So after testing now the version or update is to be released, and it should be included with the currently working code of the app. This is the place where the Operation team comes in.

So the dev team handovers it to the operation team

The responsibility of operations team is that the code is deployed properly without any problem, and it runs on all servers even while millions of people are using it.

So from this we can also get to know that both of them, the developer team and operation team need both different knowledge in technologies, they work with entire different technologies.

So communication is really required here between these two teams, then only the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) will move smoothly.

The dev team have to create many instructions to give to the operation team so that they can deploy the app without any problem, but the barrier between them creates many problems and hence it would affect the release time and deployment of the app
To prevent this DevOps introduced. It is a culture to work in corporation with both the teams.

So a DevOps engineer need to know the things from both dev and operation teams POV 

Okay, so this is all about the intro to DevOps. This is just a very beginner-friendly intro.More stuff is to come on the next pages
